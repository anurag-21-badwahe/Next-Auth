- ** Read Employee**: Managers can easily *read* there existing employee information, including name, email, salary, and status (active/inactive).

- **Delete Employee**: Managers can remove employees from their list when they are no longer employed.

## Technologies Used

- **Full-Stack Framework**: Next.js
  - Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack applications, providing server-side rendering, static site generation, and client-side rendering capabilities.

- **Frontend Libraries**:
  - Formik: A popular form management library for React.
  - Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the server.

   **Backend**
   -Handled Full backend in Next js
  
   APIs.
  - MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing employee data.
  - Mongoose: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.

  - Mailtrap: Used Mailtrap for email verification to ensure that manager emails are valid and verified.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/employee-management-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd employee-management-app
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   npm run dev
   ```

5. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to access the application.

## Security Measures

- **Authentication**: Implement user authentication to ensure that only authorized managers can access their employee lists.
- **Authorization**: Set up role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to certain features or employee data based on the user's role.
- **Data Encryption**: Use encryption techniques to secure sensitive employee information stored in the database.
- **Input Validation**: Validate user input to prevent common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
